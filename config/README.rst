Config
======

Types
-----

This directory contains the configuration directories for different types of
packages:

* pure-python

    - Configuration for a pure python package which supports PyPy.

* pure-python-without-pypy

    - Configuration for a pure python package which does not supports PyPy,
      e. g. the packages Zope depends on.

Contents
--------

Each directory contains the following files:

* packages.txt

    - This file lists the packages which use the configuration in the
      directory.
* gitignore

  - This file is copied to `.gitignore`.
* setup.cfg

    - common setup.cfg, which should be copied to the repository of the
      package
* tox.ini

    - tox configuration, which should be copied to the repository of the
      package
* travis.yml

    - Importable config for TravisCI, usage see below.

Usage
-----

To use the configuration provided here in a package call the following script::

    $ ./config-package.py <path-to-package> <config-type-name>

See ``--help`` for details.

The script does the following steps:

1. Add the package name to `packages.txt` of the selected configuration type if
   it is not yet added.
2. Copy `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini` and `.gitignore` to the repository.
3. Edit `.travis.yml` to contain the following lines::

     version: ~> 1.0
     language: python
     import: zopefoundation/meta:config/<type>/travis.yml

   Where `<type>` is the name of the used directory.
4. Run the tests via: ``tox``
5. Create a branch and a pull request.

After running the script you should manually do the following steps:

1. Make sure TravisCI runs the ``master`` branch once a week. (See settings of
   the package on TravisCI).
2. Make sure the package is activated on https://coveralls.io by trying to add
   the repository name and making it active.
