======
Config
======

Purpose
-------

Bring the configuration of the zopefoundation packages into a common state and
keep it there.


Types
-----

This directory contains the configuration directories for different types of
packages:

* buildout-recipe

  - Configuration for a zc.buildout recipe. It is tested using multiple
    processes, so coverage has to be configured in a special way. (Supports
    pure python packages which also run on PyPy.)

* pure-python

  - Configuration for a pure python package which supports PyPy.

* pure-python-without-pypy

  - Configuration for a pure python package which does not supports PyPy,
    e. g. the packages Zope depends on.


Contents
--------

Each directory contains the following files:

* packages.txt

  - This file lists the packages which use the configuration in the
    directory.

* editorconfig

  - This file is copied to `.editorconfig` and allows developers to have a
    common editor configuration experience in all repos.

* gitignore

  - This file is copied to `.gitignore`.

* MANIFEST.in

  - Configuration file for the MANIFEST to include all needed files in sdist
    and wheel.

* setup.cfg

  - common setup.cfg, which should be copied to the repository of the
    package

* tox.ini

  - tox configuration, which should be copied to the repository of the
    package

* travis.yml

  - Config for TravisCI.


Usage
-----

Preparation
+++++++++++

The script needs a ``venv`` with some packages installed::

    $ python3.8 -m venv .
    $ bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

To use the configuration provided here in a package call the following script::

    $ bin/python config-package.py <path-to-package> <config-type-name>

See ``--help`` for details.

The script does the following steps:

1. Add the package name to ``packages.txt`` of the selected configuration type
   if it is not yet added.
2. Copy ``setup.cfg``, ``tox.ini``, ``.travis.yml``, ``MANIFEST.in`` and
   ``.gitignore`` to the repository.
3. Remove a possibly existing ``.coveragerc`` and ``bootstrap.py``. (Coverage
   is now configured in ``setup.cfg``.)
4. Run the tests via: ``tox``
5. Create a branch and a pull request.

After running the script you should manually do the following steps:

1. Check for changes in the updated repository and for the need of a change log
   entry over there.
2. Make sure TravisCI runs the ``master`` branch once a week. (See settings of
   the package on TravisCI).
3. Make sure the package is activated on https://coveralls.io by trying to add
   the repository name and making it active.
4. Check in possible changes in the zopefoundation/meta repository.


CLI arguments
+++++++++++++

The following arguments are supported.

--no-push
  Avoid pushing at the end of the configuration run.


Options
+++++++

It is possible to configure a deliberately small set of options a `.meta.cfg`
inside the package repository. This file also stores the template name and
commit id of the *meta* repository at the time of the run. This file is
generated during the configuration run, if it does not exit or at least gets
updated.

.. code-block:: ini

    [meta]
    template = pure-python
    commit-id = < commit-hash >
    fail-under = 98


Meta Options
------------

template
  Name of the template, the configuration was run.
  Currently read-only.

commit-id
  Commit of the meta repository, which was used for the last configuration run.
  Currently read-only.

fail-under
  A minimal value of code coverage below which a test failure is issued.


Hints
-----

* Calling ``config-package.py`` again updates a previously created pull request
  if there are changes made in the files ``config-package.py`` touches.

* Call ``bin/check-python-versions <path-to-package> -h`` to see how to fix
  version mismatches in the *lint* tox environment.
